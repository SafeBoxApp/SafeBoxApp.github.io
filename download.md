### DroidGuard Helper
MicroG's DroidGuard Helper is required to support apps that use GMS SafetyNet. The DroidGuard Helper executes SafetyNet and preserves user private information. The DroidGuard Helper can be acquired and built from [MicroG's github repository](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore). It is recommended though to use the DroidGuard Helper APK below that has been verified to be compatiable with SafeBox.
