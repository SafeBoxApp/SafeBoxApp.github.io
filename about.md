SafeBox is an app through which you can run your Andrioid apps in a more secure and fully controlled environment.

### More Information

First of all, current SafeBox is not compatible with the [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info) framework, although SafeBox does indirectly inherit certain features from [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info). Unlike [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info), SafeBox is not that intrusive and does not require a rooted device or a customized ROM. SafeBox itself is just a regular Android app, and looks more like a launcher to normal users. Under the hood, SafeBox places hooks into a target app, traps its interactions with the underlying Android framework, and allows users to control the execution environment for the app.
